This little utility is without whistles and bells, it's a mere exercise inspired by the work of "frhack": Amazon S3 bucket listing.

All the "system" is in two plain HTML pages with confused JavaScript and a classic release of jQuery.

What this program can do:
	Browse your public bucket and show to users a comprehensive list of files instead of a good formatted, yet unfriendly and un-user-able, xml file.
	The script will not work with more than 1000 objects, which is the current (as I write) limit for a truncated XML list... as far as I know this script will not work with 100 file either :P it's too crappy ... or well.. let's give it a try.

What this program can't do:
	The complement of what it can do.

* Installation
You have to configure your bucket to be public, after that, configure it to expose a index page for the anonymous user.
Configure _s3browserfiles/browser.html:
	Set urlThisDocument with the name of the page itself.
	Set urlPublicBase with your bucket CNAME or bucket URL in case you don't own one.
	Set urlS3BrowserFolderExclude with the name of the folder which holds the file itself... in case you dislike the one I provided.
	Set urlS3BrowserIndexExclude with the name of the index file in order to exclude it from the list.
Configure index.html to properly locate the browser.html page within the IFRAME, if you use a CNAME for the bucket then this URL must be the canonical one provided by Amazon (ex my.bucket.s3.amazonaws.com) and not the CNAME one.
Copy index.html along with _s3browserfiles folder (and its content) into the root folder of your public bucket.
Call your bucket from your index page and et voilà!

You should also consider to setup a couple of IAM policies to manage your bucket files.
